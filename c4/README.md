*Object-oriented programming with C examples*
This demonstrates how we can do polyphormphism in C.  The SHAPE_HEAD macro defines the common fields of a shape.  We use function pointers to allow each shape to define its own area and perimeeter functions.  A set of macros allow us to use a simpler function-style call to the different functions.
